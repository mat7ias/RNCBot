# [Awesome Raiden is has moved!](https://github.com/mat7ias/awesome-raiden) ⚡

[14/7/2019] The scope of the Awesome Raiden list went too far past the scope of the RaidenInfoBot repo so I made it separate https://github.com/mat7ias/awesome-raiden

## ⚡ RaidenInfoBot
A [Telegram bot](https://t.me/RaidenInfoBot) with a collection of resources about Raiden Network (and some misc. features). Currently running in https://t.me/RaidenNetworkCommunity (unofficial)

whenmoon: >

  The speed of light is 299.8km/s (or 299.792.458m/s). Average distance to the Moon is 384400km at the closest two points. 1.28 seconds on average for information traveling at the speed of light to reach the Moon.

  Although I think we can be more accurate about When Moon since the distance fluctuates between 363104-405704km. Which means that if we ignore computation/processing time the shortest time to the moon is 1.21 seconds ([time for light to reach the surface of the Moon from the Earth](https://i.imgur.com/nj8q3db.png)).

  For the longest time, we need to do a bit more and make some assumptions. First is that being the longest distance also implied that we have no direct line of sight and that we will need to send our Raiden Network transfer with the help of satellites. [OneWeb are setting up satellites with a low earth orbit of 1200km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneWeb_satellite_constellation) so let's assume that's our satellite orbit for the Earth.

  For the Moon, we will also need to send the Raiden Network transfer to the furthest point and again need to use satellites. The lowest realistic lunar orbit is 15km (to avoid hitting lunar mountains, [which reach heights of 6.1km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit)).

  So now we need to find the distance [for this path](https://i.imgur.com/a8VxSnm.png). With some quick maths, we can figure this distance out as such [this](https://i.imgur.com/1zNeIMt.png) and our final maximum distance being a total of 431538km. Again if we ignore computation/processing time between the Payee and Payer then we have a maximum transfer time of 1.44 seconds.

  I am happy to officially announce that Raiden Network can Moon in 1.21-1.44 seconds. Hope this helps!

adminpolicy: >

  RNC Admin Policy:

  1.  Enforce the Rules of Conduct for RNC with the conditions below.

  2.  No bans towards members regardless of how much they break the Rules of Conduct, given they?re not obviously bots (refer to rule 4)The most severe restriction available to non-bots is temporary Read-Only. If it?s not clear if they?re a bot then PM the user and judge depending on their response.

  3.  Don't ban trolls but give a warning then remove messages if it gets excessive and is breaking Rules of Conduct. We can collectively discuss actions beyond that with active admins (if you?re the only active admin and you decide urgent action is needed for the sake of the community then do it).

  4.  Stay censorship free focused. Never use admin rights to silence other members on individual judgement. If Rules of Conduct for the group is being broken then that requires a discussion with that individual (starting with a warning referred to in rule 3) then if they continue a discussion with active admins is needed on whether or not to go ahead with temporarily restricting the user (starting with a short/temporary restriction, usually 7 days or less). A restriction can be requested to be
  reviewed at any point.

  5.  Ban obvious non-human bots (or restrict them to read only).

  6.  In regards to direct shilling, make it clear this is a Raiden focused group and staying on topic is part of the Rules and Conduct in the Pinned Message. For indirect shilling please be polite and try and steer the conversation back to Raiden if you feel it's having a negative impact.

  7. Excessively negative comments towards other Raiden channel admins is not allowed by admins in the RNC group. Members can talk about it how they want but remind them to keep it civil if they start breaking RNC Rules Of Conduct.

  8.  No changes to admins without cooperation and collaboration between that active admin or if they're MIA then all active admins. Sometimes people don't want to mod anymore, that's fine as long as you bring it up. Please don't go MIA due to not wanting to put in effort to moderate. This isn?t a chore so if it feels that way please let one of the other admins know before it gets to that point.

  9.  Any changes to admin policy or significant changes to Rules of Conduct and description/logo need a vote. Voting lasts for 24 hours or until majority is reached. Obviously if someone has mentioned they're on holidays or will be away this rule does not apply.

  10.  No admin can help link someone's identity to their personal account on telegram with the information they have within this admin channel. That will result in possible suspension and collaborative discussion of being removed from that admin of RNC.

mainnet: >

  Mainnet:

  For mainnet make sure to run an Ethereum node - [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases) (faster to sync) or [Geth](https://ethereum.github.io/go-ethereum/downloads/) (longer) then follow [How to install a Raiden node on the Ethereum Mainnet](https://youtu.be/fy2ctCQHfD4). Or if you don't want to run an Ethereum node you can use [Infura](https://Infura.io) and add --eth-rpc-endpoint https://NETWORK.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_TOKEN making sure to run Raiden on the same network as Infura.

  Find the Red Eyes Mainnet Tutorial documentation [here](https://raiden-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/red_eyes_mainnet_tutorial.html)

  Lightning vs. Raiden:

  Q: Bitcoin has one solution for layer 2 scaling that's almost canonical in that community, which is the Lightning Network. Whereas in Ethereum you have a much more fragmented space in L2, even within the Plasma community or the State Channels community, there isn't really one solution that everyone is coalescing around. Why do think that is and how much of a problem do you think that is for the community? [Answer summary](https://t.me/RaidenNetworkCommunity/26274)

cost: >

  Blockchains are of limited capacity. The max capacity of Bitcoin was reached a long time ago, and the max capacity of Ethereum is starting to near it's maximum. Once the capacity is reached, the only way to ensure a transfer or smart contract is included is to pay more to get it on. The cost skyrockets, and Bitcoin is already at $5 dollar per transfers and rising, making it unusable for any regular payments. Raiden on the other hand can handle over 60.000 times more transfers than the Ethereum blockchain - and is basically free.

  In fact, you can probably imagine transactions that are smaller in value than the transaction cost of using the blockchain. Thus Raiden opens the possibility for entire new methods of business that are simply impossible on the blockchain.


  /back to menu.

speed: >

  To transfer something on the bitcoin blockchain and to get it validated by later blocks, takes about 90 minutes. For Ethereum, it takes several minutes. By the time the payment completes, the value of the token used could change a lot, and the information sold might be obsolete. Imagine the internet using minutes to load each page! Meanwhile, Raiden is nearly instant. Near instant transfers will be the only acceptable standard in the emerging machine-machine information economy.


  /back to menu.

privacy: >

  On the blockchain, the entire world knows that Alice transfered 0.005 ETH to Bob, and the exact time of when it happened. Every transaction is communicated to every participant. This has been an reason why, for instance P2P solar power companies haven't used them - it goes against EU (and other countries) laws to publicize how much power each household is consuming. As an business or individual you generally don't care about having the entire world know each individual sale you did. Collecting everything in a payment channel and then putting the total balance on the blockchain at the end of the day is better for you.

future: >

  Anything that requires speed and low fees. Especially, it is suitable for small payments in the Internet of things, where emerging machine connectivity and info derived from them could be extended into a single global marketplace.

  Furthermore, it is for example, ideally suited for the small-scale solar power industry, where you can buy and sell power at much better rates than now. Also ad companies making payouts per second of watched ads, accessing paywalled content via a 'pay as you go' model, smaller businesses or temporary/seasonal businesses that can't access VISA or just wanna avoid expensive fees.

  Lastly, getting near free global transfers makes possible totally new business-models that are unfathomable right now.

  The Raiden team is also building raidEX, an decentralized exchange that will be on the network.


  /back to menu.

developers: >

  The system has no fees except the ones needed to incentivize nodes in the network. They will thus have no reason to create their own network since that would be more costly and time-consuming for them.

  The protocol itself is open for innovation and additions are encouraged. Already, a large number of companies have committed to using it or to build apps upon it. 3rd party developers building upon it is actively encouraged, with the Raiden team having dedicated 16% of all tokens towards funding 3rd party open source projects on the Raiden Network.


  /back to menu.

obsolete: >

  First let's clarify, the Raiden Network is not intended to outcompete Ethereum, but to make it better and more valuable.

  Secondly, the future improvements to Ethereum such as Casper, Sharding and Proof of Stake is needed anyway to increase capacity, and are vital for Ethereum to be mass adopted by the general public. The better Ethereum works, the better for Raiden. What can be said though, is that scaling Ethereum up is hard and will take years. It is also totally unfeasible that the transaction fees and speed will be able to compete with the Raiden network.

everything: >

  [Here!](https://github.com/mat7ias/RaidenResourcesBot/blob/master/README.md)

token: >

  The RDN token is used to pay and receive the small node incentivization fees that are necessary for the network to provide good UX. Since most users won't run full nodes, but a lighter app, there will be a Light Client Gateway Service Fee for them to connect to the network through a full node. Other providers of services on the network will provide pathfinding and channel monitoring services; all of these services be paid in RDN.

  As the network grows, the circulation and value of the RDN token will grow, however, the network itself will not become more expensive to use, since a growing number of nodes will compete for traffic through lowering their fees.

  These fees are necessary for such an network to function, because running larger full nodes has a cost in effort, bandwidth and the number of tokens locked in a channel deposit.

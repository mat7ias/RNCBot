whenmoon: >

    The speed of light is 299.8km/s (or 299.792.458m/s). Average distance to the Moon is 384400km at the closest two points. 1.28 seconds on average for information traveling at the speed of light to reach the Moon.

    Although I think we can be more accurate about When Moon since the distance fluctuates between 363104-405704km. Which means that if we ignore computation/processing time the shortest time to the moon is 1.21 seconds ([time for light to reach the surface of the Moon from the Earth](https://i.imgur.com/nj8q3db.png)).

    For the longest time, we need to do a bit more and make some assumptions. First is that being the longest distance also implied that we have no direct line of sight and that we will need to send our Raiden Network transfer with the help of satellites. [OneWeb are setting up satellites with a low earth orbit of 1200km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneWeb_satellite_constellation) so let's assume that's our satellite orbit for the Earth.

    For the Moon, we will also need to send the Raiden Network transfer to the furthest point and again need to use satellites. The lowest realistic lunar orbit is 15km (to avoid hitting lunar mountains, [which reach heights of 6.1km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit)).

    So now we need to find the distance [for this path](https://i.imgur.com/a8VxSnm.png). With some quick maths, we can figure this distance out as such [this](https://i.imgur.com/1zNeIMt.png) and our final maximum distance being a total of 431538km. Again if we ignore computation/processing time between the Payee and Payer then we have a maximum transfer time of 1.44 seconds.

    I am happy to officially announce that Raiden Network can Moon in 1.21-1.44 seconds. Hope this helps!

adminpolicy: >

    RNC Admin Policy:

    1.  Enforce the Rules of Conduct for RNC with the conditions below.

    2.  No bans towards members regardless of how much they break the Rules of Conduct, given they?re not obviously bots (refer to rule 4)The most severe restriction available to non-bots is temporary Read-Only. If it?s not clear if they?re a bot then PM the user and judge depending on their response.

    3.  Don't ban trolls but give a warning then remove messages if it gets excessive and is breaking Rules of Conduct. We can collectively discuss actions beyond that with active admins (if you?re the only active admin and you decide urgent action is needed for the sake of the community then do it).

    4.  Stay censorship free focused. Never use admin rights to silence other members on individual judgement. If Rules of Conduct for the group is being broken then that requires a discussion with that individual (starting with a warning referred to in rule 3) then if they continue a discussion with active admins is needed on whether or not to go ahead with temporarily restricting the user (starting with a short/temporary restriction, usually 7 days or less). A restriction can be requested to be
    reviewed at any point.

    5.  Ban obvious non-human bots (or restrict them to read only).

    6.  In regards to direct shilling, make it clear this is a Raiden focused group and staying on topic is part of the Rules and Conduct in the Pinned Message. For indirect shilling please be polite and try and steer the conversation back to Raiden if you feel it's having a negative impact.

    7. Excessively negative comments towards other Raiden channel admins is not allowed by admins in the RNC group. Members can talk about it how they want but remind them to keep it civil if they start breaking RNC Rules Of Conduct.

    8.  No changes to admins without cooperation and collaboration between that active admin or if they're MIA then all active admins. Sometimes people don't want to mod anymore, that's fine as long as you bring it up. Please don't go MIA due to not wanting to put in effort to moderate. This isn?t a chore so if it feels that way please let one of the other admins know before it gets to that point.

    9.  Any changes to admin policy or significant changes to Rules of Conduct and description/logo need a vote. Voting lasts for 24 hours or until majority is reached. Obviously if someone has mentioned they're on holidays or will be away this rule does not apply.

    10.  No admin can help link someone's identity to their personal account on telegram with the information they have within this admin channel. That will result in possible suspension and collaborative discussion of being removed from that admin of RNC.
